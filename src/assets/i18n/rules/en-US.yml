  pretext: >
    In Arcs, you lead a spacefaring society through an epic saga, as you try to survive in the
    harsh and dangerous Reach at the galaxy’s edge. A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough
    **Power**—essentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least **27
    Power**. With 3 players, **30 Power**. With 2 players, **33 Power**. When the game ends, the
    player with the most Power wins.<br><br>

    You gain Power by completing **ambitions**, which are objectives that you declare in play.
    These are scored at the end of the **chapter**, when everyone runs out of action cards. The
    game lasts a varying number of chapters, usually three to five.<br><br>

    Your first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a few times, a
    game should take about 30 minutes per player.<br><br>

                their starting pieces differently.
              - Use the ***Guild and Vox cards*** specific to the campaign Court (marked “CC”). Do
                not use the cards for the base Court (marked “BC”).
              - Use the same deck of ***lore cards*** as the base game (marked “L”), but you will
                shuffle lore into the Court deck after dealing the Court.

        players check who gets initiative for the next round. You’ll learn more in **Playing a
        Chapter** (see `rule-relative::Playing a Chapter`)!<br><br>

        Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards in their hand. At this point,
        the chapter ends, players gain Power from ambitions they fulfilled, and everyone draws a
        new hand of cards. You’ll learn more in **Ending a Chapter** (see `rule-relative::Ending a
